To help keep your Nintendo Switch's SD cards up to date with homebrew

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get your Nintendo Switch's SD cards setup properly for running homebrew applications. It is never recommended to use this repository as your main source of the latest homebrew developments, only as an accessory to help keep your SD card updated. It is always recommended to follow [Plailect's Switch Hacks Guide](https://switch.hacks.guide) to understand what files are being placed onto your SD card and what each file is for, ensuring you know how to use them and whether or not you want them.

### Prerequisites

1. An SD card formatted as FAT32 or exFAT, preferably the one that came with your Nintendo Switch
2. A proper installation of [git](https://git-scm.com) on the device you will use to update your SD card
3. Patience if you have slow internet
